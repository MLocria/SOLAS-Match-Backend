SOLAS Match Worker Daemon
============================

## What is this?

This is the back end to the SOLAS Match web application. It is used
to process things asynchronously. It connects to the same MySQL DB 
as the main web application and communicates asynchronously using
RabbitMQ. This is an AMQP based message queueing architecture for
cross platform IPC. Once the worker daemon has been started it
connects to the RabbitMQ server mentioned in the conf file and starts
processing any messages found. It is massively parralelised with each
consumer running on a different thread. Once a message has been 
consumed a new thread is launched into a locally managed threadpool
to handle the message while the original thread goes back to polling
RabbitMQ.

## System Requirements

The SOLAS Match Worker Daemon was built using Qt 4.8 on Ubuntu 12.04
but it should work on a cross platform environment.
