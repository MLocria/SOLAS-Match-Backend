Information for volunteers:
Thank you for your interest in volunteering! Please make sure to update your user profile and set notifications on your profile if you want to be notified of new translation projects by email. All non-profits benefitting from your translations will be asked to credit you by name on their translated materials. You can also request a reference letter detailing your contributions directly on your profile page.

Information for non-profits:
If you represent a non-profit, please make sure to create a profile for your organisation on the site. This will allow you to make materials available to volunteers for translation. We require all organisations to credit translators by name on their translated materials.

    The {{SITE_NAME}} Team
