        Hello,
    {{/NO_USER_NAME}}
</p>

<p>
    You have claimed a "{{TASK_TYPE}}" task for "{{TASK_TITLE}}" from {{SOURCE_LANGUAGE}} into {{TARGET_LANGUAGE}} on {{SITE_NAME}}.
</p>
<p>
    Thanks for helping to volunteer.
</p>
<p>
    You can translate or revise using Kat贸 TM or alternatively edit the file you downloaded on your local PC.
</p>
<p>
    As soon as you have processed the file on Kat贸 TM (and all segments are marked as translated or approved (revising)),
    please copy it "from Kat贸 TM to Kat贸 Trommons" using the following page:<br />
    {{TASK_PAGE}}
</p>
<p>
    Or if you edited on your local PC, upload the output file on the following page:<br />
    {{TASK_PAGE}}
</p>
<p> 
    You can then request a reference letter on your Profile page. 
</p>

<p>
    Sincerely,<br />
    The {{SITE_NAME}} Team
</p>
